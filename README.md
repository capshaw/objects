# objects

Hey, world. I'm experimenting with the illustration side of web development and I thought it would be fun to build some icons and 2D representations of physical objects. This repository is the resulting showcase of those icons.

Right now, the images are PNG exports from a vector Sketch file. In the future I'd like to export SVG and / or build a font from these images.
